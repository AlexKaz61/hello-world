# hello-world
my first repository

Hello! I'm Alex and I'm being forced to write stuff about myself so here goes.
I'm looking to get into programming and make a living out of it. I figured starting with web development was a good way to get into things as html and css seem simple enough and javascript is hella popular. I like games and anime as well as a good cup of coffee.
I've always wanted to learn to code and after a lot of procrastination and excuses it's time to get started!
